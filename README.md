# Configuration files for tools I used on linux

I'm learning to use tools to be more productive using a Linux Terminal. For that reason, I have created and/or copied configurations for them.

* Alacritty: An easy Terminal emulator. Its configuration is done via a YAML file. 
* Nvim: A fork of Vim with improvemnts for end users and developers.
* Git: Source Control System. I only added alias to the common operations. In a future, I will create git webhooks.
* Tmux: Terminal multiplexer. This is the last tool I've been learning. I can have multiple Terminals and I can split them. 
* ZSH: A replacement to Bash. I have the default configuration. I will create a better structure for this in a future.
